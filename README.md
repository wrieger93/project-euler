ProjectEuler
============

my projecteuler solutions, in a variety of languages (mainly c++, python, and mathematica). each problem has its own folder. do with it whatever you want.

i try to keep the running time of my programs less than 60 seconds, but this will obviously vary from machine to machine. also, there are some problems i have not figured out how to do in under 60 seconds. i'll try to remember to put a comment that for each problem where it's too slow.
